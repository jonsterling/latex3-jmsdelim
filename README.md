The `jmsdelim` package
======================

A package for compositional delimiter sizing.

The following files are included:
- `jmsdelim.dtx` : the doctrip source for the package and documentation
- `jmsdelim.ins` : the generation script for producing `ebproof-rules.sty`

The package requires `expl3` (the LaTeX3 programming environment) which
provides many useful programming tools.

To build the documenation, run `l3build doc`.
